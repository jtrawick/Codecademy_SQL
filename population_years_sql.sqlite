--Below is the Codecademy.com World Populations SQL Practice for the SQL course with my corresponding solutions

--Prerequisites
--1. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Learn SQL Manipulation and Learn SQL Queries lessons.

-- This is the first query:

 SELECT DISTINCT year from population_years;

-- Add your additional queries below:


--Project Requirements

--3. The first query has already been written for you to answer the following question: 
--What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).

 SELECT MAX(population)
 FROM population_years;

--4. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

 SELECT year, MAX(population)
 FROM population_years
 WHERE country = 'Gabon';

--5. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

 SELECT *
 FROM population_years
 WHERE year = 2005
 ORDER BY population
 LIMIT 10;

--6. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

 SELECT DISTINCT country
 FROM population_years
 WHERE year = 2010
   AND population > 100;

--7. How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

 SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM population_years
 WHERE country LIKE '%Islands%';

--8. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
--Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.

--So for this one, I decided to do two queries: one that is the easier, manual 
--version showing the two years side-by-side where you could just subtract the
--two. The other, below, is one that does the calculation for you.

-- This is the alternative with no subtraction operation

SELECT year, population
FROM population_years
WHERE 
    (country = 'Indonesia'
    AND year = 2010) 
  OR 
    (country = 'Indonesia'
    AND year = 2000)
ORDER BY year DESC;

--And this is the alternative with no subtraction operation

SELECT
  (SELECT population 
  FROM population_years
  WHERE country = 'Indonesia'
    AND year = 2010)
- 
  (SELECT population 
  FROM population_years
  WHERE country = 'Indonesia'
    AND year = 2000)
AS indonesia_growth;
