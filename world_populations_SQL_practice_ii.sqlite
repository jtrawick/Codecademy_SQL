-- 1. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Learn SQL Manipulation, Queries, Aggregate Functions, and Multiple Tables lessons in our Learn SQL course.


-- 2. In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.
-- There are two tables:

-- countries
-- id	INTEGER	Primary Key
-- name	TEXT	
-- continent	TEXT

-- population_years
-- id	INTEGER	Primary Key
-- population	NUMBER	(in millions)
-- year	NUMBER	
-- country_id	INTEGER	Foreign Key

-- Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

-- When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.


-- 3. How many entries in the countries table are from Africa?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Countries in Africa'
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Africa';


-- 4. What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?


SELECT 
  countries.continent AS 'Continent',
  SUM(population_years.population) * 1000000 AS '2005 Total Population' 
FROM countries
JOIN population_years
  ON population_years.country_id = countries.id
WHERE population_years.year = 2005
  AND countries.continent = 'Oceania';


-- 5. What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?

WITH joined AS 
(
SELECT  *
FROM countries
JOIN population_years
  ON countries.id = population_years.country_id
)
SELECT
  continent AS 'Continent',
  year AS 'Year',
  ROUND(AVG(population), 1) AS 'Average Population 2003 in Millions'
FROM joined
WHERE year = 2003
 AND continent = 'South America';


-- 6. What country had the smallest population in 2007?

WITH joined AS 
(
SELECT  *
FROM countries
JOIN population_years
  ON countries.id = population_years.country_id
)
SELECT
  joined.name AS 'Country',
  MIN(joined.population) AS '2007 Lowest Population in Millions'
FROM joined
WHERE joined.year = 2007;


-- 7. What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?

WITH joined AS 
(
SELECT  *
FROM countries
JOIN population_years
  ON countries.id = population_years.country_id
)
SELECT
  joined.name AS 'Country',
  ROUND(AVG(joined.population), 1) AS 'Average Population in Millions 2000-2010'
FROM joined
WHERE name = 'Poland';


-- 8. How many countries have the word “The” in their name?

SELECT COUNT(name) AS 'Country Names with "The"'
FROM countries
WHERE name LIKE '%The%';


-- 9. What was the total population of each continent in 2010?

WITH joined AS 
(
SELECT  *
FROM countries
JOIN population_years
  ON countries.id = population_years.country_id
)
SELECT
  continent AS 'Continent',
  SUM(population) AS 'Total Population 2010'
FROM joined
WHERE year = 2010
GROUP BY continent;
